## 📌 Motivation

* According to **Wikipedia**, experts state that *a woman is victimized every 16 minutes* in India.
* **Conviction rates for rape cases have shown a declining trend:**

  * 44.3% in 1973
  * 37.7% in 1983
  * 26.6% in 2010
* The decline indicates **serious concerns about judicial efficiency and victim justice**.
* **NCRB reports**:

  * *Madhya Pradesh* has the highest **raw number** of reported rape cases.
  * *Delhi* has the highest **per capita rate** of rape cases.

---

## 🏗️ Project Objectives

* Analyze trends in rape case statistics across decades.
* Compare conviction rates and highlight systemic weaknesses.
* Visualize **state-wise case distribution** (absolute vs per capita).
* Provide **data-backed insights** for policymakers, researchers, and students.
